  "description": "A warrior of faith, his sword the Word of God, cleaves through darkness with divine precision. In the shadowed visage of Baphomet, severed by the soldier of Christ, two natures stand revealed in judgment: the right eye, dark and beastly, snarls with the savage pride of Satan, adorned with horns of rebellion; yet the left eye, glowing white and elevated, gleams as a fallen star, once bright in glory, now cast down, its light a mocking remnant of the adversary’s lost dominion. This radiant shame proclaims Yahweh’s sovereign might, as pencil lines evoke the soldier’s victory, lifting high the beast’s head to declare the triumph of the redeemed—Satan shattered, his abyssal reign annihilated by the blood-stained cross of Christ Jesus, immortalized in every stroke.",
